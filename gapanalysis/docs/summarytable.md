The table below summarizes the taxonomic ranks represented in the names entered. The table shows the total number of taxonomic names at each rank and the breakdown of names by novelty to the GGBN and GenBank databases. Each name is assigned to one category:

- New to GGBN: name is NOT found in the GGBN Data Portal and is found in the GenBank DNA barcodes
- New to GenBank: name is found in the GGBN Data Portal and is NOT found in the GenBank DNA barcodes
- New to Both GGBN and GenBank: name is found in neither the GGBN Data Portal nor the GenBank DNA barcodes
- Already in Both GGBN and GenBank: name is found in both the GGBN Data Portal and the GenBank DNA barcodes

Inputted names are matched to the GBIF taxonomic backbone, and higher rank taxonomic names are taken from those matched records. For example, if a list of 20 family names is inputted into the application, those 20 names will be matched to \~20 GBIF records. Then the counts and statuses of kingdoms, phyla, classes, orders, and families will be determined from those \~20 matching GBIF records.
